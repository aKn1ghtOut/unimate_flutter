# unimate_flutter

A new Flutter project, for use by students of Shiv Nadar University. This is supposed to replace all the functionality of the SNUHacks app, currently in use and add more features on top.

## To try out the app

    1. Make sure you have Flutter installed(https://flutter.io) with Dart version >= 2
    2. Clone this repository locally, open a new terminal in the folder
    3. Run **flutter pub get** to get the required Flutter packages
    4. Run **flutter run** with a device connected, to run the app in debug mode.

Note: Flutter apps run slower in debug mode, so do not assume it'll be the final runtime speed.

For help getting started with Flutter, view the 
[online documentation](https://flutter.io/docs), which offers tutorials, 
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
